# ConvNetSharp
C# port of [ConvNetJS](https://github.com/karpathy/convnetjs)

## Disclaimers
- Work in progress: some code may be incomplete. In mnist demo, the algorithm is not converging as fast as in Andrej Karparthy implementation -> Something is fishy.
- I haven't included mnist data files. You need to download them from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ into ConvNetSharp\MnistDemo\bin\Release\Mnist before running mnit demo.

Thank you very much to the original author (Andrej Karpathy) and to all the contributors to ConvNetJS!
